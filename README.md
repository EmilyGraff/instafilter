# Instafilter

An easy RESTful API for manipulating images and applying customizable filters in real-time.

Also available through a RESTful API at [instafilter.io](http://www.instafilter.io).

# How to use it
The application requires the [Play Framework v1.2.5](http://www.playframework.org/download)

I am hosting a cloud version of Instafilter at [instafilter.io](http://www.instafilter.io). You can use it in the cloud and forget about hosting and maintaining it. I will obviously charge for it but the pricing is flexible, so contact me for high volume discounts.

# Support
You can contribute to the project by opening a GitHub issue, submit a pull request, or contact me on twitter [@thefosk](https://twitter.com/thefosk) for feedback.
